## 4. File Tree Sidebar

- [ ] `FileTree` component in `components/FileTree.tsx`
  - [ ] Receives `projectName` as prop
  - [ ] Collapsible — collapses to thin bar with icon to re-expand
  - [ ] Draggable/resizable width like VS Code
- [ ] Recursive file tree rendering
  - [ ] Renders folders and files
  - [ ] Folders have chevron, tap to expand/collapse inline
  - [ ] Files show correct icon per extension (.js, .ts, .css, .md, etc.)
- [ ] Tap file to open in editor
- [ ] Long press file or folder for context menu
  - [ ] Context menu appears as popover near the long pressed item
  - [ ] File options: Rename, Delete, Move
  - [ ] Folder options: New File, New Subfolder, Rename, Delete, Move
  - [ ] Rename — inline input replaces item name, Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel
  - [ ] Delete — confirmation alert
  - [ ] Move — inline input for destination, Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel
  - [ ] New File inside folder — inline input appears inside folder
  - [ ] New Subfolder — inline input appears inside folder
  - [ ] Refresh tree after every operation
- [ ] New file button at top of sidebar — inline input appears in tree at current folder level
- [ ] New folder button at top of sidebar — inline input appears in tree at current folder level
- [ ] Inline naming: type name, Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel — no modal
- [ ] Active file highlighted in tree
- [ ] Temporary editor screen `app/editor/[name].tsx`
  - [ ] Receives project name from route params
  - [ ] Renders FileTree on the left
  - [ ] Empty placeholder on the right for now

## 5. Multi-Tab System

- [ ] Tab bar component across top of editor
- [ ] Open file adds a tab
- [ ] Tap tab to switch to that file
- [ ] Close tab (x button)
- [ ] Unsaved changes indicator on tab (dot or asterisk)
- [ ] Tabs persist scroll/cursor position per file
- [ ] Max tab limit or horizontal scroll for many tabs
- [ ] File tree sidebar collapsible (toggle button)
- [ ] File tree sidebar resizable/movable like VS Code

---

## 6. Custom Native Code Editor

### 6a. Tokenizer
- [ ] Define token types: `keyword`, `string`, `comment`, `number`, `operator`, `identifier`, `punctuation`, `whitespace`
- [ ] Write tokenizer for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Write tokenizer for HTML

---

## 7. Save System

- [ ] Auto-save on pause (debounced, ~1s after last keystroke)

- [ ] Unsaved changes tracked per file
- [ ] Warn before closing unsaved file

---

## 8. Git Integration (isomorphic-git)

### 8a. Setup
